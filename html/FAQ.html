<H1>c3270 Frequently Asked Questions</H1>

If you have a problem building, installing, or running c3270, please browse
through this file first.

<H2>General Questions</H2>

<H3>Am I allowed to use it?</H3>

    Yes.  Full copyright information is in the
    <A HREF="Lineage.html">Lineage</A> file, but the gist
    is that anyone is free to use the code, and anyone is free to sell copies
    of the code.
<P>
    You are also free to modify it and to redistribute it, provided you
    preserve the existing copyright notices.

<H3>Why are notsign characters (and other accented characters) displayed as
blanks or strings of garbage?</H3>

<P>
The most common cause of this is a problem with locales, in particular, the
codeset (LC_CTYPE) in use.
There could be a mismatch between the locale that the <b>c3270</b>
process is using and the locale supported by the terminal hardware or
terminal emulation software that <b>c3270</b> is running on.
For example, <b>c3270</b> may be running in a locale that uses UTF-8
encoding (e.g., en_US.UTF-8), while the terminal it is running on does
not support UTF-8.
Or it may be running on a terminal emulator (<b>xterm</b>,
<b>gnome-terminal</b> that is running in a non-UTF-8 locale, such as
en_US.ISO8859-1.
<p>Use the <b>show stats</b> command at the <b>c3270&lt;</b> prompt to
display the locale codeset that the <b>c3270</b> process is using.
<p>Note that the locale conflict can easily arise when <b>c3270</b> is run on
a remote host, e.g., in an <b>ssh</b> session.
The remote host (where the output is being generated) and the local host
(where the output is being interpreted and displayed) can often have different
default locales.
<p>It is also possible that <b>c3270</b> was built without UTF-8 support.
In order to support UTF-8, <b>c3270</b> must be built with an <b>ncurses</b>
or <b>curses</b> library that supports wide characters.
The <b>show stats</b> command will also indicate whether or not <b>c3270</b>
supports UTF-8.
